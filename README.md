<br />

## Install
clone the repo via git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/status-im/status-x.git
```
And then install the dependencies with `yarn`.

```sh
cd status-x
yarn
```

To develop:

```sh
yarn run start
yarn run lint
````

To run:

```sh
yarn build
node dist/index.js
```

`status-x` requires `geth` or `murmur` to be able to connect to Whisper. If using `geth`, you may start it with the following flags.

`geth --testnet --syncmode=light --ws --wsport=8546 --wsaddr=localhost --wsorigins=statusjs --rpc --maxpeers=25 --shh --shh.pow=0.002 --wsapi=eth,web3,net,shh,debug,admin`

Also, due to the lack of nodes with Whisper enabled, you need to create a [static-nodes.json](https://github.com/status-im/murmur/blob/master/src/data/static-nodes.json) file, that must be placed in a specific path (if using testnet and Linux, `~/.ethereum/testnet/geth/static-nodes.json`

## Commands
*TODO*

* `/join #channelName` - join a channel
* `/s 1` - switch to channel or chat indexed 1
* `/msg 0xpubkey` - start a chat with user given his pubkey
